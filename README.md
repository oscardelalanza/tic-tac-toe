# tic-tac-toe

In this project, We build a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. 

### Game description
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### How to Play 
+ Run the file `ruby bin/main.rb`
+ Enter your player name, and let the other player enter their player name too
+ The game automatically assigns the first player the X token and the second player the O token
+ Follow the instructions on the user interface i.e enter the number of the grid where you would like to place your token
+ Do not place your token on a grid that is already chosen by the other player
+ The first player to succeed in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
